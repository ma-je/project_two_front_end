Rui's Ruminations Blog

This blog was constructed on top of templates provided by General Assembly for front end as well as backend, therefore, it inherits all of the technologies built into the template (i.e., bootstrap, rails GEMS, etc)

This Blog doesn't have any particular focus; It is simply a place for the blogger(admin) to ruminate about anything. S/he could even ruminate about the creation of this app and how the compulsive rumination about this development process can lead to clinical disorder. Per Wiki, "Rumination is the focused attention on the symptoms of one's distress, and on its possible causes and consequences, as opposed to its solutions.[1] Both rumination and worry are associated with anxiety and other negative emotional states". Huh, perhaps, this could be the topic of the very first official blog post.

This platform was created for someone who likes to share their perspectives on various topics.

This Blog allows only one user (the Admin) to post any articles. Perhaps at a later date, other users will be allowed to post. When you land on the page, the post article form is not accessible. If you are a registered admin user, you will see the form. For now, only the admin.

The original intent was to allow anyone to read the Blog, however, only subscribed users can post a comment. Due to time constraints, this functionality had to be tabled. The plan is to revisit this at a later date.

User Stories

* As a user, I’d like to be able to subscribe to the blog

* As a user, I’d like to be able to post comments on articles (this is tabled for later deploy)

* As a user, I’d like to be able to be able to change my
  password

* As an admin user, I’d like to be able to post new articles to the blog (the admin credentials for testing are mmonteiro gmail address and pwd = test)

* As the admin user, I’d like to be the only one to be able to post articles

* As a user, I can only post a comment if I am signed in (see issues concerning comments above)
*

Features still to be added:
* The ability to edit post and all features related to the ability to comment on posts. I am able to make updates in the console, however, not within the browser (yet).

Major bug: After days of trying to get the edit post to work (consulting with Dr. google, consultants, former students, current students), I realized that I needed to move this up the chain the senior developers. The code appears to be correct, however, for some reason the 401 unauthorized error message persists.

Would like to add:
* social media buttons
* perhaps an archive
