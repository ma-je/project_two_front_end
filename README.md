Rui's Ruminations Blog

This blog was constructed on top of templates provided by General Assembly for front end as well as backend, therefore, it inherits all of the technologies built into the template (i.e., bootstrap, rails GEMS, etc)

This Blog doesn't have any particular focus; It is simply a place for the blogger(admin) to ruminate about anything. S/he could even ruminate about the creation of this app and how the compulsive rumination about this development process can lead to clinical disorder. Per Wiki, "Rumination is the focused attention on the symptoms of one's distress, and on its possible causes and consequences, as opposed to its solutions.[1] Both rumination and worry are associated with anxiety and other negative emotional states". Huh, perhaps, this could be the topic of the very first official blog post.

This platform was created for someone who likes to share their perspectives on various topics.

This Blog allows only one user (the Admin) to post any articles. Perhaps at a later date, other users will be allowed to post. When you land on the page, the post article form is not accessible. If you are a registered admin user, you will see the form. For now, only the admin.

Anyone can read the Blog, howerver, only subscribed users can post a comment.
Currently, this functionality is not working. If a user tries to leave a comment they will ge an error message (400 bad request)

Features still to be added:
* The remaining CRUD actions (specifically, UD)
* Brining the data onto the browser window

Would like to add:
* social media buttons
* perhaps an archive
